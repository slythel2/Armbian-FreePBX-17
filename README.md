# Armbian 12 Bookworm FreePBX 17 Installer (ARM64)

A vibe-coded, "one-click" installer for Asterisk 21 and FreePBX 17 on Debian 12 (ARM64).

**Disclaimer:** This is an amateur project created solely for my personal workflow to quickly deploy PBX systems on T95 Max+ TV boxes. I am hosting it here for my own convenience and storage. It works for me, **it should work on every ARM64 Debian 12 device** but it might not work for you. Use entirely at your own risk.

## **FreePBX 17 & Asterisk 21 Installer**
**Installation**
Requires a clean Armbian (Debian 12 Bookworm ARM64) installation and root access.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slythel2/FreePBX-17-for-Armbian-12-Bookworm/refs/heads/main/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
Simply copy and paste.

## Features
* **One Click Install:** Every dependency Asterisk or FreePBX needs will be installed aswell.
* **Fast Deployment:** Uses pre-compiled Asterisk 21 artifacts to skip long compilation times.
* **Modern Stack:** Debian 12 (Bookworm), FreePBX 17, PHP 8.2.

## (Extra Content) Armbian 12 Image for T95 Max+ Android TV Box
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd161989-dca9-49a2-a757-504306ed0648" width="30%">

You will also find a custom Armbian image in the **Releases** section of this repo.
* **Source:** Derived from ophub builds.
* **Target:** T95 Max+ (Amlogic S905X3 SoC).
* **Why:** I included a custom **auto-install script** that automatically corrects paths and selects the correct options and configurations specifically for this TV box.
* **Status:** Heavy WIP. Not polished, but functional for this project **IF YOU HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME TV BOX**
* **Features:** 2GB swap already configured.

# Instructions:
1. Burn it with Rufus or BalenaEtcher on a USB stick or SD Card
2. Remove the power cable, insert your USB stick/SD Card; there is a button at the bottom of the 3.5mm jack hole.
3. With a toothpick, apply pressure on the button until you hear a click, insert the power cable, keep the button pushed for 6-10 seconds.
4. It will automatically install and power off by itself.
5. Connect via ssh: root - 1234

Note for T95 Max+

SD card boot should always be the priority as far as I know.
Since this is based on ophub Amlogic build, after the installation the toothpick method to boot up via USB won't be usable anymore.
You can still force USB boot by nuking the eMMC:

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=1M count=1 && sync
```
